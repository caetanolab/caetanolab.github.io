##### Personal XR and AI
------------
I build AI and XR toolkits that enable solutions personalized to usersâ€™ bodies, minds, and environments. To make highly tailored solutions scalable and reduce the marginal cost of personalization we must answer:
- How to balance scale and personalization?
- How to identify and model contextual and user factors critical for design?
- How to preserve human agency in this process?

I research these questions through ability-based and co-design methods, supported by AI agents, user models, simulations, and 3D processing.
