## Arthur Caetano

PhD Candidate [@UCSB/HAX](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~sra/index.html)


I design and evaluate **personalized XR interfaces for AI instruction and feedback**. My research applies to domains such as outdoor AR language learning, MR intelligent cooking support, and XR accessibility. Grounded in ability-based and co-design, I align XR environments to usersâ€™ needs and abilities using point cloud processing, kinematic simulations, LLMs, and spatial preference models. Ultimately, I want to help people to overcome their limitations and maximize their productivity and well-being through personalized AI and XR.
