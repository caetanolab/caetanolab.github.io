##### Personal XR and AI
------------
XR and AI are transforming one-size-fits-all solutions into personalized experiences—adapting to your body, environment, and individual needs. But moving from mass-produced to custom-made raises critical questions:

- Can technology truly understand user’s unique needs?
- How to design one-of-a-kind solutions at scale?

I research these questions through ability-based design and co-design, leveraging powerful tools like 3D-processing, kinematic simulations, LLMs, and preference models. My goal is to enhance productivity and well-being beyond our limits through personalized AI and XR.
