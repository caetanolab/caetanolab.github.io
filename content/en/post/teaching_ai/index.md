This work was developed during the [UCSB Summer Research Academy](https://summer.ucsb.edu/programs/summer-research-academies/overview), a program dedicated to cultivating research skills in high school students. In this program, I had the privilege to interact with exceptionally bright and motivated students as their research methodology teaching assistant.
